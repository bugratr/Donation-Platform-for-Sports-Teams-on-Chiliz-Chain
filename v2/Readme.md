# Donation System Flow
The donation system enables users to contribute to different teams using either CHZ or specific Fan Tokens. Upon initiating a donation, the user selects the desired token and specifies the amount to donate. The system then processes the transaction, ensuring that 5% of the donation is directed to the news platform's wallet, while the remaining 95% is sent to the selected team's wallet. In appreciation of the user's contribution, an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is minted and sent to the user's wallet as a memorabilia. The sequence diagram below provides a visual representation of the flow of this donation system:
