# Donation Platform for Sports Teams on Chiliz Chain

## Overview
This project is a donation platform designed to allow sports fans to financially support their favorite teams and news platforms directly. Built on the Chiliz Spicy Testnet, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, the platform ensures a seamless donation experience. When a donation is made, 95% of the funds go to the selected sports team's wallet, while 5% is sent to the news platform's wallet as a commission.

## Chiliz Chain Integration
The application leverages the Chiliz blockchain, which is optimized for creating fan tokens and other sports & entertainment applications. This project particularly benefits from Chiliz's low transaction fees and high throughput.

### Prerequisites for Chiliz Chain
- Ensure that your wallet (e.g., Metamask) is configured to connect to the Chiliz Spicy Testnet.
- You need some test CHZ tokens in your wallet to interact with the Chiliz testnet.
