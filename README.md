# Donation Platform for Sports Teams on Chiliz Chain

## Overview
This project is a donation platform designed to allow sports fans to financially support their favorite teams and news platforms directly. Built on the Chiliz Spicy Testnet, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, the platform ensures a seamless donation experience. When a donation is made, 95% of the funds go to the selected sports team's wallet, while 5% is sent to the news platform's wallet as a commission.

## System Contribution

The implementation of this donation system brings multifaceted benefits to news websites, Chiliz Chain, and football teams. News websites can experience an increase in revenue through user donations and enhanced user engagement facilitated by the interactive donation feature. Chiliz Chain benefits from increased adoption as it finds utility in new use cases, and also witnesses a surge in transaction volume due to the flow of donations. Football teams, on the other hand, gain additional funding through direct contributions from fans and enjoy enhanced fan engagement as supporters can actively contribute to their favorite teams.
